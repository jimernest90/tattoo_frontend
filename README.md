# Konetink 

This site is a prototype for something that will eventually be something larger. This is a walk through of what a larger site would be with multiple tattoo artists. You will be able to go through the collection of artists and pick who you would like to contact. Then you will be able to send out a form with multiple specifications of your preferences. The artist will recieve this and respond to you in a speedy manner. 
This site was made with Semantic UI, React, and Ruby on Rails.
